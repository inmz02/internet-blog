        <p>
          This is my area of the internet. Not many people have personal blogs
          that is not fame, money, or attention from others. I miss the days
          when people would express themselves online via their creativity of
          their space on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>To not lose yourself online and enjoy life</p>
